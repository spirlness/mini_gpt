The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. This is a simple test dataset for mini GPT.
Machine learning is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience.
Deep learning is part of a broader family of machine learning methods based on artificial neural networks.
Natural language processing is a subfield of linguistics, computer science, and artificial intelligence.
A transformer is a deep learning model that adopts the mechanism of self-attention.
GPT stands for Generative Pre-trained Transformer, a type of large language model.
Character-level modeling treats each character as a token in the sequence.
The goal of language modeling is to predict the next token given previous tokens.
Training neural networks requires large amounts of data and computational resources.
Mini GPT is a simplified implementation for educational purposes and experimentation.
